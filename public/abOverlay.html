                <p>AI Asteroids Bot is a project built on top of the Kessler Game. The game consists of randomly
                    spawning asteroids, and some ships that need to fight for their survival by shooting the asteroids,
                    or flying away, or both.

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    The bot is built on a fuzzy architecture -- some loose rules to decide whether we fight or flight,
                    or both.
                    On its own, the architecture doesn't provide very much value.
                    <br>
                    Using a genetic algorithm, turning hyperparameters like when an asteroid is too close for comfort
                    and how quickly the ship turns around
                    gives us a much more responsive bots. Fitness is determined by shooting accuracy, survival time, and
                    more.
