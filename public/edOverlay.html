                                Just like the learning rate optimizer on a ML system, I made a final tiny step compared
                                to my initial
                                leap
                                from Biology to Computer Engineering. I made this switch because of my affinity for
                                doing. The
                                classes where
                                I got to build systems with real use cases, I enjoyed the most.

                        <div class="timeline-content">

                            <p>
                                A great step.
                                <br>
                                Taking a computer science elective shocked me. Studying wasn't a chore, since the
                                assignments felt
                                like cool projects
                                that I felt myself gravitating towards during my free time.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So then I made the switch from Biology to Computer Engineering -- I picked Engineering
                                over Computer
                                Science over some
                                arbitrary assumptions that Computer Engineers get to learn more. A small regret I would
                                come to
                                have. But still, it was
                                a big leap that was very rewarding. I always spent lots of time learning about tech
                                developments, so why didn't
                                I begin University with a tech-related degree?

                            <p>I started University being interested in Optometry and Physiotherapy. I couldn't commit
                                to exactly
                                what I would do, but I spent time in high school studying nutrition + strength
                                programming and
                                the degredation of peripheral vision.<br>
                                I started University in Biology, and I took a Computer Science course as an elective.

                                That's when everything changed.
