                            <p>I'm currently taking Computer Science. My love for Computer Science comes from my love of technology and creation. Computer Science is often
                                learned through repeated applications, which is amazing. I get to create cool projects like this website, while learning. And there's never 
                                a shortage of ideas in my mind that I'd like to implement.

                            <p>My first venture into the world of software. Switching majors from Biology to Computer Engineering was drastic, but so refreshing. Working on
                                assignments that mirrored real world applications made assignments feel like real projects. Everything was great, except for one thing. I didn't
                                enjoy the electrical classes that focused on theory.

                            <p>Biology was my strongest subject in high school, and I had an idea of pursuing medical school. However, I became jaded with my degree and
                                eventually realized I prefer applied sciences over theoretical ones. I still loved learning about the inner workings of the brain and the body,
                                but I was often itching apply my knowledge to something useful.
